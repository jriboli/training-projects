    * Algorithms should be 'deterministic':
    * Given the same input, the algorithm should always produce the same output.

    * The algorithm should be correct for any arbitrary valid input.
    *
    * Time complexity: As the input size grows, how much longer does the algorithm take?
    * Space complexity: As the input size grows, how much more memory doe the algorithm use?
    *
    * Complexity is described by a function (math formula). Most common vairalbe you'll
    * see is n, this should represent the value that changes between inputs, and it directly
    * affects the algorithm.

     * - Tend to infinity
